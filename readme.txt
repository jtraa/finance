This project is made for training purposes.


I'm building a financial system because my previous job was assistant accountant. That's why I as programmer have a lot of
knowledge of the finance department. It will be a small system with relations, debitors/creditors, 
creating and viewing invoices, with booking lines and numbers, creditors invoices, balans and profit/losses review.
